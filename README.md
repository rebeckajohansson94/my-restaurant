# My restaurant

## Description
A restaurant website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Structure
- `index.html`: The actual webpage
- `css/style.min.css`: Custom CSS styling
- `js/logic.min.js`: JavaScript logic for functionality
- `js/listeners.min.js`: JavaScript listeners for functionality

- Included in the structure there's also `css/style.css`, `js/logic.js` and `js/listeners.js`. These are the non-minified versions of the files used on the website. This is for easier editing and viewability. Once done with the editing, use an online CSS/JS minifier to optimize your files. 

## Usage
1. Download and extract the zip file.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser of choice to show the site.
